# Assignment-Module Challenge # 10: 

sqlalchemy-challenge.

## Short description:

This challenge combines both data analysis and app development. It is divided into two main parts:

#### Part 1: Climate Data Analysis
This part focuses on analyzing climate data using SQLAlchemy, Pandas, and Matplotlib, and is divided into two sections:

1. Precipitation Analysis:

- Use Python, SQLAlchemy, Pandas, and Matplotlib to analyze climate data.
- Connect to the hawaii.sqlite database using SQLAlchemyâ€™s create_engine() function.
- Reflect the database tables into classes with automap_base() and query the precipitation data.
- Retrieve the precipitation data for the last 12 months, plot the results, and generate summary statistics.

2. Station Analysis:

- Query the total number of stations and identify the most active station based on observation count.
- Retrieve temperature data for the most active station over the last 12 months, plot a histogram of the temperature observations, and close the session.

#### Part 2: Climate App Design

This part involves building a Flask API with the following routes:

- /: Homepage that lists all available routes.
- /api/v1.0/precipitation: Returns a JSON of the last 12 months' precipitation data.
- /api/v1.0/stations: Returns a JSON list of stations.
- /api/v1.0/tobs: Returns temperature observations for the most active station from the last year.
- /api/v1.0/<start> and /api/v1.0/<start>/<end>: Returns a JSON with the minimum, average, and maximum temperatures for the specified date range.

This challenge encompasses both climate data analysis and the creation of a Flask-based API to present the data.
